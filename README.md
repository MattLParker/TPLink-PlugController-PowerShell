#TPLink Plug Controller Module for PowerShell
This is a PowerShell module that can be used for controlling a TPLink HS100 or HS 110 smart plug.

Big thanks to [EgoManiac's TPLink-PoSH](https://github.com/EgoManiac/TPlink-PoSH) for the code base for this project. My goal with this was to: cleanup the code, convert this to module format, and give myself a project.
